            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>
                Becoming a web developer involves acquiring a diverse skill set encompassing both technical expertise and creativity. Start by learning the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages form the backbone of web development and are essential for creating interactive and visually appealing websites.
                
                Next, familiarize yourself with web development frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, which streamline the development process and enhance productivity. Additionally, acquire knowledge of server-side programming languages like Node.js, Python, or Ruby on Rails to build dynamic web applications.</p>

                Becoming a full-stack web developer involves mastering both front-end and back-end technologies to build dynamic, interactive websites and web applications. Start by learning front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are essential for creating the visual layout, styling, and interactivity of a website.
                
                Next, delve into front-end frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, which provide tools and components to streamline development and enhance user experience. Additionally, familiarize yourself with back-end technologies like Node.js, Python (with frameworks like Django or Flask), or Ruby on Rails, which handle server-side logic, database interactions, and authentication.</p>

            <p>
                As a beginner or "baby" web developer, there are several key steps you can take to start your journey in web development:
                
                Learn the Basics: Begin by understanding the fundamentals of web development, including HTML for structuring web pages, CSS for styling them, and JavaScript for adding interactivity.
                
                Choose a Path: Decide whether you want to focus on front-end development (working on the user-facing part of websites) or back-end development (working on the server-side logic and databases). You can also aim to become a full-stack developer, proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>
